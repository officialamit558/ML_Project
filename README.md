# Goal
Develop an object recognition  model .The objective is to train a model that will be able to identify relevant Elements in a webpage.

# Objective:
Implement a computer vision architecture to perform element detection and identification.
The model should be able to identify elements like Breadcrumb, checkbox, container, dropdown Forms, buttons,logo images,Navigation dots, text, links, input fields, radio, modal.
Model should be able to create a bounding box around each element and tag it with the desired element name.
Use the above mentioned elements' names as tags.

# Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using quantitative metrics .
Your model should work on any other figma webpages and submission will be ranked upon that .
Sample reference images
https://www.figma.com/community/file/1132396044075007632/tortilicious-a-fast-food-app for evaluation you have  to detect elements from these types of figma web pages.
Sample results
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16jbyjKMfgdv6l5QHLaDRH44kv4iAwCgZ?usp=sharing your model should be able to generate these types of results.(Results are just an example).
